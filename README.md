# Reinforcement Learning (RL)

This repository contains implementations of various Reinforcement Learning algorithms and environments. It serves as a centralized hub for exploring and understanding different approaches to solving complex decision-making problems.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/A-A7med-i/RL.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd reinforcement-learning
```



## Algorithms

* **Q-Learning:** A classic off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that learns an action-value function.
* **SARSA:** An on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that learns an action-value function using an on-policy behavior policy.
* **Deep Q-Networks (DQN):** A deep learning-based approach to reinforcement learning that addresses the problem of overestimation bias.
* **Policy Gradient Methods:** A family of algorithms that directly learn a policy function to map states to actions.
- **Actor-Critic Methods:** A class of algorithms that combine both policy-based and value-based approaches.


## Examples

- **CartPole-v1:** A simple environment where the goal is to balance a pole on a cart.

* **MountainCar-v0:** A more challenging environment where the goal is to drive a car up a hill.
* **LunarLander-v2:** A more complex environment where the goal is to land a lunar lander safely on a landing pad.



## Environments

* **OpenAI Gym:** A toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.
* **Custom Environments:** [Describe any custom environments you've created or plan to create]
